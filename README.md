# PyBer_Analysis

# Overview of the analysis
The purpose of this analysis is to provides a detail breakdown of total riders, drivers, fares, average fare, driver by city type. 

# Results
In general, there were fewer total rides and drivers in the rural area when compared to the number of riders in the suburban and urban area. Riders in this area pay more on average per ride and the drivers are paid more for their services. In the urban area, there are more riders and drivers. In this area, the riders pay less when compared to the rural area riders. Furthermore, riders in the rural areas pay three times that amount that riders in the urban area pays. As illustrated in the image below, suburban riders pay and use Pyber services less than urban riders but more than rural riders.

# Summary
